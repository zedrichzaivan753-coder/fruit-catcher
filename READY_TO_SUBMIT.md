flutter run -d windows
```

Take photos of:
- [ ] Game running with fruits falling
- [ ] Scoreboard showing score/level
- [ ] Game over screen with "Play Again" button

Save as:
- `screenshot_gameplay.png`
- `screenshot_scoreboard.png`  
- `screenshot_gameover.png`

### 2. Prepare Submission Folder

Create a folder with:
```
