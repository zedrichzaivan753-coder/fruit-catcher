# 🎮 Fruit Catcher - Gameplay Guide

## 🏆 How to Score Big

### Understanding Points
- **Base**: 10 points per fruit
- **Multiplier**: × Current Level
- **Example**: 
  - Level 1: 10 points per fruit
  - Level 2: 20 points per fruit
  - Level 3: 30 points per fruit
  - Level 10: 100 points per fruit

### Level Progression
Every **100 points** = Level Up
```
0-99 points    = Level 1
100-199 points = Level 2
200-299 points = Level 3
300-399 points = Level 4
...
```

## 📈 Difficulty Scaling

### What Happens Each Level Up?

**Spawn Rate Decreases** (fruits come faster)
```
Level 1: 2.0 seconds between fruits
Level 2: 1.85 seconds
Level 3: 1.7 seconds
Level 4: 1.55 seconds
...
Minimum: 0.5 seconds (hard cap)
```

**Fall Speed Increases** (fruits fall faster)
```
Level 1: 200 pixels/second
Level 2: 250 pixels/second
Level 3: 300 pixels/second
Level 4: 350 pixels/second
...
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Beginner Tips
1. **Position Early**: Move basket to predicted landing spot before fruit arrives
2. **Center Position**: Start near the middle of the screen
3. **Smooth Movements**: Don't jerk the basket, make smooth motions
4. **Focus**: Watch the entire screen, not just your basket

### Intermediate Tips
1. **Anticipate Patterns**: Fruits spawn randomly, but watch for clusters
2. **Stay Mobile**: Keep moving to catch multiple fruits in quick succession
3. **Edge Awareness**: Don't let fruits reach the bottom
4. **Speed Management**: As difficulty increases, use quicker, smaller movements

### Advanced Tips
1. **Memorize Zones**: Know the screen width to catch fruit at edges
2. **Optimize Movement**: Every pixel counts at higher levels
3. **Predict Spawn**: Random but uniform - watch for timing patterns
4. **Stay Calm**: Panic at high levels leads to mistakes

## 🍎 Fruit Identification

All fruits have equal value - no bonus for catching specific types!
- 🍎 Apple
- 🍌 Banana

### Late Game (Levels 8+)
